# DataSet_Processing_For_Report
Python Program to import a data such as xls or csv and generate customized reports with functions to create tables, pivot tables and graphycs

I made this for report automation using an CSV input file with columns that contain poject milestons such deliverables plan and actual dates, or custom contents that projet members use for communicating information (such as subcontractor names)
